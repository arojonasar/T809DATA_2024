I don't expect the batch estimate to be exactly (-1,2) due to the randomness of the data.
It's expected to be close to the mean, but not exactly.
To get a closer real mean to the expected, the variance parameter could be lowered.
That means that the data points have 'smaller space' to cluster around, so it gets closer to the real mean.
You could also increase the number of samples (data points) to get the real mean closer to the expected.
When the amount of data points is increased, the 'realer' the mean gets.
If you toss a coin twice, you can not expect to get heads once and tails once,
but if you toss the coin 5000 times, the number of heads should be very close to 2500.
