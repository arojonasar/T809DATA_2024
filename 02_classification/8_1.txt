(Question A) Compare the accuracy of both datasets, if the results are different, what explains the difference?

Answer: Just when looking at the figure from Section 2, it's very different. 
The data points in this later dataset are far apart and the seperation between classes is very clear.
What explains that, is that the means are further apart (-4 and 4), and the standard deviation is lower (sqrt(2)),
so the data points are not as spread as in the first dataset where the standard deviation is sqrt(5).
For these two reasons, I would say that the accuracy of the later dataset is higher, because it's easier to distinguish between the classes.


(Question B) What happens when you change the:
    number of datapoints
    mean of the normal distributions
    standard deviation of the normal distributions
Explain in a few words how and why each of these affect the accuracy of your model.

Answer: 
* Number of datapoints
I would think that generally, if you generate more datapoints, the model should get more accurate. Honestly, I cannot see much difference in this model. 

* Mean of the normal distributions
When the means are further apart, it's less likely that the data points overlap between classes, making the accuracy of the model higher.

* Standard deviation of the normal distributions
The higher the standard deviation, the more spread out the data points. Which makes it more likely that the data points overlap between classes.
So to make the accuracy of the model higher, I would lower the standard deviation.
