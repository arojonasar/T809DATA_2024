The predictions are a bit off. To help with visualizing the performance, I plotted two figures.
The first one, 5_a.png, shows the predictions versus the actual values.
Each point represents one prediction, and the closer to the red line, the more accurate the prediction.
As we can see the predictions are not very accurate, and the higher the actual value, the more off the prediction is.
The other figure, 5_b.png, shows a pattern in the error. The figure shows residuals (predictions - actual values) on the y-axis 
and actual values on the x-axis. The red line is a reference line. If all points were on this line, the model would be perfect. 
However, that is not the case here, instead, the dots (residuals) are in a fairly straight line downwards,
meaning that for low actual values, the model tends to overpredict (high residual value),
but for higher actual values, the model underpredicts (low residual value).
This suggests that the model is biased and isn't capturing the relationship between the features and targets as well as possible.
